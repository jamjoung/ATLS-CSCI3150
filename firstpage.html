    <p>Despite the criticism it has received, <a href='https://finalfantasyxv.square-enix-games.com' title='Final Fantasy XV Website'>Final Fantasy XV</a> is one of my favorite games.</p>
    <p>I played it when it first released in 2016, which is hard to believe it has been <strong>7 years</strong> already.</p>

    <p>I hope to play the remake of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> when I have more time, and play more of <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> which I started awhile ago (and I'm not very far).</p>
